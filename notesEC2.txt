EC2 day1 notes. 10/17/2020

1. EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) 
2. In order to spin up EC2 instance we need AMI (Amazon Machine Image). It's an Operating System/
Platform/Linux/Unix flavor. 
3. There are 2 kind of Images (Public/Private).
4. Private Images are Hardened (Encrypted) Images
5. LTS (Long Term Suuport) means its a stable version. 
6. Images are regional. Means Image ID is unique per region. 
7. EBS (Elastic Block Store) used for persistent volumes or storage. 
8. Drowback of EBS --> Only accessible within one AZ 

Create our 1st Custom AMI 

1. AMI comes with pre configured software 
2. Once SSH into the Instace first thing we need to verify OS family/flavor
3. In order to find out the OS family --> cat /etc/*-release or cat /etc/os-release 
4. Most famous Package Manager for RedHat, Centos and Fedora is YUM. 
5. Running commands with root user is not a good practice. Because we don't want to have wide open privileges in system. 
6. Update packages from internet --> sudo yum update -y 
7. Install Apache/PHP --> sudo yum install -y httpd php 
8. Starte Apache/HTTPD service --> sudo service httpd start 
9. Status Apache/HTTPD service --> sudo service httpd status 
10. To start HTTPD at boot time --> sudo chkconfig httpd on

Configure PHP 

1. Add ec2-user to apache group --> sudo usermod -aG apache ec2-user 
2. Change ownership of /var/www directory --> sudo chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www 
3. echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
4. In order to create Private Image from existing EC2 instance --> Actions --> Image --> Create Image 
5. Give a name and description to Image 
6. On the left side bar under the Images --> AMIs --> find image 
7. Spin up Instance from private image --> Actions --> Launch --> Follow the steps of EC2 configuration. 


EC2 EBS 

1. You can only attach 1 EBS volume to a single EC2 instance 
2. EBS volume only available inside single AZ. For example: you can only attach the volume in the same AZ. 
3. Delete on Termination by default disabled. We can enable like this.
4. First click on storage and copy device name. Such as /dev/xvda or /dev/sda 
5. SSH into the instce and create a file.json using vi text editor. 
[
    {
        "DeviceName": "/dev/xvda",
        "Ebs": {
            "DeleteOnTermination": false
        }
    }
]
6. IAM--> Add User --> Programmatic access --> Save CSV file
7. aws configure --> Copy and paste Access key Id and Secret Access key accordingly. 
8. aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <Copy InstanceID> --block-device-mappings file://file.json 

Attach volume to Ec2 instance and configure 

1. lsblk --> Returns attached devices 
2. mkfs -t ext4 <DeviceName> --> Creates file system 
3. mdkir /data --> Create this absolute path to persist the data in the absolute path 
4. mount /dev/xvdf /data/ --> Mount filesystem /data directory
5. Run lsblk command again and check the output. 

There are 2 kinds of storages: Persistent and Ephemeral.

Ephemeral storage is a weak or vulnerable storage. Data is available only during the VM running time.
